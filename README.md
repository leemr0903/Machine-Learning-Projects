      (<a href="Final_Project_Machine_Learning_LEE_MADDIE.pdf">PDF Report</a>)
    </strong><br>
    This final project explores whether demographic and lifestyle factors can predict mental health conditions. Using a simulated dataset of 1,000 individuals from diverse backgrounds, the analysis evaluates five machine learning models: support vector machines, LASSO regression, boosting, bagging, and neural networks. Key predictors such as stress levels, work hours, and sleep habits were identified as influential across models. While neural networks showed strong training performance, generalizability remained a challenge. The findings inform actionable strategies for early intervention and mental health resource planning.
