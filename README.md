  <strong><a href="A5_BTREES_LEE_MADDIE.Rmd">Bagging and Boosting with Decision Trees</a></strong><br>
  Focusing on mental health data from youth in residential treatment, this project applies ensemble methods including bagging, boosting, and random forests to identify predictive risk factors for well-being.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><a href="A6_7_PCA_CLUSTER_LEE_MADDIE.Rmd">PCA and Clustering Analysis</a></strong><br>
  This project explores college admissions data using PCA and clustering techniques to uncover patterns in financial aid distribution and standardized test scores, providing insights for strategic admissions planning.
</p>

<p>
  <strong><a href="A8_NN_LEE_MADDIE.Rmd">Neural Networks</a></strong><br>
  A deep learning approach is used to model mental health outcomes for at-risk youth. Neural networks are applied to identify key psychological risk factors and enhance prediction accuracy.

    <a href="Final_Project_LEE_MADDIE.Rmd">Predicting Mental Health Conditions Using Machine Learning</a>
    (<a href="Final_Project_Machine_Learning_LEE_MADDIE.pdf">PDF Report</a>)
  </strong><br>
  This final project explores whether demographic and lifestyle factors can predict mental health conditions. Using a simulated dataset of 1,000 individuals from diverse backgrounds, the analysis evaluates five machine learning models: support vector machines, LASSO regression, boosting, bagging, and neural networks. Key predictors such as stress levels, work hours, and sleep habits were identified as influential across models. While neural networks showed strong training performance, generalizability remained a challenge. The findings inform actionable strategies for early intervention and mental health resource planning.

  <strong><a href="FitLife360Case_LEE_MADDIE.Rmd">FitLife360 Case Study</a></strong><br>
  This case study evaluates the effectiveness of a marketing campaign by analyzing app download data before and after treatment in select cities. The analysis incorporates counterfactual modeling using control groups to estimate the true treatment effect while accounting for underlying trends in control cities. The project refines impact estimates by comparing prediction models with and without key covariates, demonstrating how control-based adjustments can improve inference. Modeling approaches included predictive modeling and post-period estimation based on time-series trends.

  <strong><a href="A7_LEE_MADDIE.Rmd">Predicting Income Using Census Data</a></strong><br>
  This project uses U.S. Census data to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year. The dataset includes demographic and occupational attributes such as age, education, work class, and final weight. The analysis applies decision tree models, neural networks, and regression to evaluate predictive accuracy and identify key income-related factors. Attention is given to model complexity and generalization to ensure robust and interpretable results that could inform policy or business decisions.
